To connect earphones to your Raspberry Pi Pico, you will need:

+ A Raspberry Pi Pico
+ A pair of earphones with a 3 or 5mm jack (not a USB end)
+ 2 x crocodile clips

**Instructions**

1. Decide which crocodile clip will be for **Ground** and which will be for the **GP** pin. 

2. Take your **GP** pin crocodile clip and attach it to the tip of the jack. 

3. Take the other end of your **GP** pin crocodile clip and attach it to the **GP5** pin.

4. Take your **Ground** crocodile clip and attach one end to the base of the jack. 

5. Connect the other end of your **ground** crocodile clip to the **GND** pin closest to **GP5**. 

**Tip**: If your crocodile clips have quite large ends then you may wish to choose a **GND** pin that is further away.
